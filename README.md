Task stack is a simple CLI program written in python
----------------------------------------------------

It is based on the old physical model of using a stack of "flash cards" as a todo list, and sending flashcards to the end of the stack untill you've come across one which is easy enough to complete. Every time you see a "hard" or overwhelming task, you should create at least one new card with a simpler subtask.

Launch with:

    $ task-stack
